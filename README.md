# Open M3U8 (working name)

## Description

This is an open source M3U8 playlist parser java library that attempts to conform to this specification:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-14

Currently there is very little compliance as this is still very much a work in progress. Pull requests are welcome.

## Rationale

We would like to give back to the open source community surrounding Android that has helped make iHeartRadio a success. By using the MIT license we hope to make this code as usable as possible.
